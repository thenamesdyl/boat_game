for the boat staying afloat, it could be to where the boat has a center point that doesnâ€™t go below the height of the water? something like that.

like if there is a wave it goes up 7 chunks so the center of the boat just flows with the water, it also will be 7 chunks high? or just making the center of the boat == height of water
